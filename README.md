# Greek Computer Solver

This is an algorithm to find the solution to the [Greek Computer Puzzle.](https://www.projectgeniusinc.com/grecian-computer-solution)

The program will produce a set of instructions for a physical Grecian Computer. The starting configuration arranges each of the gears so their smallest numbers are at the 12 o'clock position, where the orientation of the 'clock' is based on the instructions printed on the back of the computer. A solution of [2, 3, 6, 8, 11] indicates that the smallest gear is rotated twice, the next largest three times, the next largest six times, etc. Rotations are counter clockwise.
